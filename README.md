## System Architecture

**Include Network Topology Diagram:**  
*Add a network topology image here (e.g., using Cisco Packet Tracer)*

# Network Design & Configuration

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates a structured network topology designed using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The network includes various interconnected devices, each assigned a specific role to ensure seamless communication and efficient management.

### üñ•Ô∏è Network Components
- **Router (1841 R1):** Acts as the central hub for managing traffic.
- **Switch (Cisco 2960):** Distributes connectivity to different segments.
- **Access Points (Cisco 3702i):** Provide wireless connectivity to different departments.
- **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC-3504):** Centralized management of wireless devices.
- **Servers:** DHCP, DNS, and WEB servers handling key network services.
- **End-user Devices:** PCs and laptops connected via wired and wireless networks.
